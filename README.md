# Machine Learning Project: Unsupervised Learning

## Project Description:
In this project, I appled unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset,
and I used data visualizations to communicate some insights gained from the analysis.

The dataset for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information 
about various products sold by a grocery store.

While working through this project, I completed the following tasks:

- I loaded, cleaned, explored, and preprocessed the data.
- I used k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering in an effort to group similar data points together.
- I used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify what percentage of the dataset's information was contained in the first two or three principal components.
